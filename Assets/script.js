// when I open planner, (document ready?)

// the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar (moment.js?)

// each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
// CLICK into timeblock button, I can enter an event (text) and CLICK save button
// timeblock text is saved into LOCAL STORAGE
